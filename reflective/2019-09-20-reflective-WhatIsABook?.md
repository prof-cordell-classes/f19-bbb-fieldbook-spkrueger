#Reflective: What is a Book?

###Stephanie Krueger



I spent most of last week with my definition of a book being constantly overturned by Amaranth Borsuk's "The Book". Every time a new form was introduced or a new experimental example was presented, my definition was altered. As of right now, I'm still processing all the examples and contradictions while trying to figure out my own definition.

We discussed how many of us hadn't thought of books as something that needed to be invented at all. I hadn't considered the invention of page numbers, margins, and the table of contents at all before reading _The Book_. Our experience at the NUArchives brought this further into perspective. The medieval prayer book was fascinating to me since it was without many of these conventions.

Throughout our discussion, I found the examples that abstracted from our basic perceptions of the codex and gave a nonlinear, interactive experience to be the most interesting. It made me question the experimental methods of artists that involve alteration or destruction of the pages. In the past, when looking at pieces of art that have been made by carving into books, burning pages, or defacing them with color, I've felt discomfort. It felt as if they are disrespecting the form of the book and the story within. I know I am one among many that felt this way about books. _The Book's_ discussion of artist books and repurposing the codex made me see these explorations in a completely new light. 
	
I have never felt this feeling of discomfort when I have seen any other piece art made of recycled plastic bottles or old clothes. On the contrary, that type of recylcing materials into art or a useful tool is really exciting! In terms of the actual text, we frequently utilize newspaper to clean up spills and make art projects, but if I ever would have used a codex to clean up a spill or paint on top of it would have felt ridiculous and wrong. 

All this leads me to believe that my previous rigid notion of the codex and the words that live within were definitely based on nostalgia and a love of the stories that often lie wihtin a codex form. I can still preserve this love whle recogizing that books come in all forms and there is no inherent harm or loss of value when its physical form is repurposed.
