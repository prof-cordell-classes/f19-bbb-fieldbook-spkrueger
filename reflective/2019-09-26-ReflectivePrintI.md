# Reflective: Print I

### Stephanie Krueger


I've always been a very visual and kinesthetic learner, so the use of video and hands-on interaction with elements of letterpress this week was really beneficial. The ability to interact with pieces of type and begin to set them in a composing stick allowed me a new appreciation for the amount of time, energy, and attention to detail it must have taken to print an book the length of the Bible in Gutenburg's time. 

In terms of our discussion, one of the most intriguing topics we disucssed last week was digital fatigue. According to the article "Well Pressed" in _The Economist_, digital fatigue is "a yearning for individualised products and hands-on experience". The author claims that this is one of the driving factors for the resurgence in letterpress printing in the digital age. They even go so far as to call it "fetishising" and say it is "so old it's new". 
	
On one hand, I can definitely see how digital fatgiue could happen - we are soaked in the culture of screens and new media. Composing an instagram post or editting photographs in lightroom certaintly takes a different skill set than operating a letterpress; they constitute a less "hands-on" experience. 

However, I don't think that digital fatigue is the reason for the return to older techniques of printing and art. As new forms of technology arise, it stands to reason that folks with creative minds and a taste for experimenting in art would look to combine the new and the old. For example, since 3D printing has become more widespread and affordable, it is now possible to experiment with combining that technology with the letterpress to create something new. I have even seen online a tiny letterpress made of parts that were 3D printed and assembled. By bringing technologies of the past into the present, we can create amazing things that none of the inventors could have forseen.

I also believe that as humans, we are nostalgic beings. We liked to be reminded of our achievements and use our powerful memories to reflect on past experiences. Otherwise, there would be no use for scrapbooking and journaling. Reflection and nostalgia are iconic parts of the human experience, as are the expression and sharing of those ideas.
