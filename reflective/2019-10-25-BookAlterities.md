# Reflective - Book Alterities

### Stephanie Krueger


I found a lot of inspriation and connections in thinking about the artist books in the NU Archives last week. 

Emre's piece about The Future Library had hopeful themes for me. In one way, it was assuming that humans would survive until 2114 and still have the time and ability to read. It asumes that climate change and the rest of our worlds ills will not be enough to stop our prosperity and love for reading. A more cynical view would be that it also is made to make us feel better about our future outlook and as if we are doing something positive for posterity. Maybe we are, but we will have no way of knowing it.

This piece also reminded me a lot of of _Baxter's Procrustes_. For all we know, any of those books could be empty. The only one who would know for the next hundred years are the authors. Furthermore, the only meaning that we the audience are able to **read** until 2114 is the meaning we find from the project itself. We may draw meaning from the project and from the titles, but not from the work until the time comes.

Another connection I drew from this piece was to the reflection I wrote about the destruction/alteration of books earlier this semester. In it, I talked about the uncomfortable feelings that may come with seeing books altered, cut into, or marked up. The same feelings could come from the process they are going through with the trees. The process of planting and nurturing them is much like the process of creation with books. In that way, the consequent 'destruction' or alteration of them from that creation can be seen as uncomfortable or wrong. The important part of these processes is to be able to look past the discomfort long enough to understand a work's intentions.
