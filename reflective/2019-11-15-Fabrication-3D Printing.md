# Reflection - Fabrication: 3D Printing

## The Lincoln Life Mask and Originality

I was suprised by the readings this week and to learn about all different types of fabrication other than 3D printing. I had some trouble completely understanding everything I read because it was a bit different than usual, so I was even more surprised that I had a lot to say during our class discussion. 

I particularly had a lot to say about the Lincoln life mask. One of my questions about it was: at what point does a reproduction of a work become so far removed from the original that it is something new? Or is each iteration distinct and new? It seemed to me that after so many copies of copies, recreations of moldings, that this mask may not even completely resemble Lincoln's face anymore. Furthermore, I think this question is a good one to think about when considering books in general. For example, in the case of oral storytelling, where legends and epics are passed down through generations by word of mouth, there is no way that each telling of the story can remain exactly the same. Whether it is tone of the storyteller, word choice, or missing/added details, the story must change some amount with each telling. In this way, the first telling of the story may be much different in distinct ways from the most recent telling. I wonder if each time the story is told, a new book is "made", or if every telling of the story make up one "book" as a whole.

The same arugment might be made for different representations of the same story. Are a codex book and a movie version of that same book the same book? How different must the line be between original content and copies/recreations? There are also spoof and satire recreations of works that are arguably completely new works, yet they are entirely based off of things that already exist.

Of course, there is a the idea that in our age, nothing is original anymore and all ideas have already been explored in one sense or another. But I believe there is still plenty of room for creation and part of that is taking inspiration from works past and adding your own ideas. Maybe what we can take fromt this is that there is no need to draw a line between different works of similar origin or idea, and instead we can interpret each alone **and** together.
