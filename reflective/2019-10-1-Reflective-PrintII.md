## Anthropomorphized Type

The personification of type is the theme that spoke to me the most last week. Throughout _Thinking with Type_, Lupton discusses humanist fonts. These are fonts that were specifically designed to mimic the natural hand movements in calligraphy. It consists of an entire family of fonts that are commonly used today: Garamond, Bembo, Jenson, etc. There was even a font modelled directly after the human body. I find it so fasinating that as humans we insert ourselves and our bodies into everything we touch - nature, art, industry. We insert ourselves in so much so that any deviations from these "normal" and humanist fonts were seen as useless and wrong. 

> "... they created forms that collided with typographic 	tradition and unleashed a strange new world, where 	the structural attributes of the letter— serif and 	stem, thick and thin strokes, vertical and horizontal stress— would be subject to bizarre experiments. In search of a beauty both rational and sublime, Bodoni and Didot had created a monster: an abstract and dehumanized approach to the design of letters... Type designers created big, bold faces by embellishing and engorging the body parts of classical letters."

I find the language of this quote particularly interesting, as it describes the changing of type as "engoring the body parts" and that the font was "a monster". The only intrinsically human thing about type is that it was invented by humans - as with all modern technology. So then why did we take it so personally and believe that it must reflect our style of handwriting?

Even now that we accept different forms of typeface and experiment freely with letterforms, they can bring up some real emotions. The font that I looked at this week was Eames Century Modern. It consists of a whole family of fonts in multiple weights and styles. I was most interested in the _Stencil_ and _Black_ fonts in the family. They immediately got my attention and seemed rather fun to me. The author definitely agreed; they raved about the family, calling them "joyous, busy, fun, gregarious and outspoke, daring you not to smile". The more I read of the review, the more I began to agree. The rounded letterforms, the curly serifs, it all seemed so __fun__. My best guess is that these connotations that I get from the fonts come from subconscious associations with various advertising, bright colors in magazines, and the stark difference from fonts I'm used to using for writing papers. We experience connotations based on memories, context clues, biases, and societal norms. All of it happens so fast that sometimes it is barely noticeable. 

Although sometimes it is more obvious. When I look at a resume or official document in Times New Roman I hardly notice it because it's so customary and expected. If I looked at that same resume in Comic Sans or Papyrus, I would laugh out loud (because let's be honest, that would be ridiculous).
