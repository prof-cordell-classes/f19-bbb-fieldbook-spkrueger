#Reading Prep: Print I

##Questions and Observations

1. Are letterpress printers still produced now, or are the majority of presses in circulation from when they were in more use?
2. It's interesting to me that the letterpress was used for such serious and important works when it was invented - used at first for the Bible and then other books. Now, many projects using the letterpress are largely experimental and art-based. The letterpress is certainly not the only thing that went from purely necessative use to experimental art tool in the digital age.
3. I wonder if when deciding how and where to add spaces and margins to the page, art design principles were discussed. Was it based more on reader demand and usage or also just purely pleasing the eye?
