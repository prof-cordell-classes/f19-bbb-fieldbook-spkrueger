## Questions or Observations

1. Is there a method or point of reproducing a work at which it becomes so far removed from the original that it is something new? Or is each iteration distinct and new?
2. Is it truly the Lincoln mask that holds weight and an 'aura', or is it moreso the social context in which we recognize the mask was made? Is the physical or social historical context more important for assigning meaning to this piece?
3. It's interesting that many scientists attributed their career paths to Legos. I'm not sure the same would be true for today. Not that kids don't still love legos, but there so many more outlets for creativity and they are more accessible than ever. With all the new open source technology, anyone can create.
