## Questions or Observations

1. The reading comprehension mentioned in the _Scientific American_ article say that in multiple studies, students printed out articles to understand them better and prefer reading paper books. While I do agree with these statements, it makes me wondering if some part of these preferences are due purely to social constructs. I think it is important to consider that part of it *may* be from the collective thought that reading from paper is superior. That alone might give us reason to pay more attention and read closer with paper media. They acknowledge this in the _Nautilus_ article, "may be a function less of the intrinsic nature of digital devices than of the expectations that readers bring to them".
2.  There is a bit a irony that I can't ignore in the fact that two of the articles were focused on how reading comprehension is better with paper text and how we may be more likely to skim an online work; yet, both of these articles are published for us to read online.
3. I LOVED reading _The Football Will Look Like In The Future_, it was a completely different multimedia experience that could not be had through a traditional codex.u
