# Reading Prep: Binding

### Stephanie Krueger


1. What is the imaginative appeal of sealed book that you never open? What value does this add - is it simply the rarity and exclusivity?
2. The examination of our proclivity to see books as sacred/nostalgic objects is exactly what I was discussing in my reflection two weeks ago. I definitely agree with what they said in this article about the smell of books as a commodity, badge, trope, and performance.
3. Whether we the reader realize that we are receiving subconscious information from the physicality of the book or not, we are. The article on designing a letterpress printed book gave a lot of insight as to how each decision is made from the paper to the typeface. The paper decision was based on the theme of lightness for the content, while the typeface decision had to be based on the number of sorts they had that were in good shape for the project.
