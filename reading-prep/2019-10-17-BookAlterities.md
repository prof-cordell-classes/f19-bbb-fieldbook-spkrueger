### Questions or Observations

1. What themes or messages does BÃ¶k think are important enough to include in the Xenotext? Why was the fate of bees specifically included?
2. Where does Carrion draw the line between the old art and new? Or does he believe that that line is somewhat blurred?
3. I love how Craig Mod discusses the benefit of utilizing emails and newsletters for your 'audience'. It feels very analogous to zines when he describes how email is 'old media' and more trustworthy than social media.
