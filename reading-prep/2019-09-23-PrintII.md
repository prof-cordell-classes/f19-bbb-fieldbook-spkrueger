# Reading Prep: Print II

### Stephanie Krueger

## Questions or Observations

1. What impact and point is the author trying to make by personifying typefaces? What do they mean when they say a dehumanized type or that advertisers created big bold faces by embellishing and engorging the **body parts** of classical letters?
	"Some designers viewed the distortion of the 	alphabet as gross and immoral,
	tied to a destructive and inhumane industrial 	system."
2. How did print shops keep so many new and different typefaces in stock in all these sizes and weights? Did they only specialize in a few?
3. A theme that I have been noticing the past few weeks is interactivity and the audience experience. First we talked about it in terms of the layout and physical makeup of the book, and now we are discussing the typeface and page layout. All of these interactions are much more subtle than purposeful reading, and yet they have a larger impact than we realize.
