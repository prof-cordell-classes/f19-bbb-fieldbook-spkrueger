# Reading Prep: E-lit II

## Questions or Observations

1. I found _The Deletionist_ very interesting. It creates erasure poems from any webpage after you click it on the bookmarks bar. At first I thought the page was just not opening and I didn't understand. Then I saw our course website and realized what it had done. It seems to use a certain rule (that may be different) each time. In the first case, it saved all the words beginning with T. I think it's a really interesting way to create 'poetry' out of websites with text that was not necessarily meant to be poetry at all.
2. I think _With Those We Love Alive_ and other E-lit stories, it is potentially easier to draw the reader in by giving them 'choice' and allowing the clicking to be an interactive element, as if they are unfolding the story themselves.
3. There is also something very interesting to me in _With Those We Love Alive_ when they ask you to draw different sigils on your skin as the story progresses. It is almost giving the story a physical form even more real than a codex because it is part of your skin and body now.
